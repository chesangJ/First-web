<body><h2>My first week at AkiraChix</h2> 
    <p>My first week at AkiraChix was more of an anxiety filled moment than a thrilled one.After spending a week and having an actual experience of the program I knew this was where i belonged. 
      <ol>My good experiences
        <li>The warm welcome by the aluminis</li>
        <li>The serene environment</li>
        <li>The lessons are intresting</li>
      </ol>

      <ul> My bad experiences
        <Li>I have problems adapting to the weather patterns</Li>
        <li>I also have a hard time interacting with people because of the different nationalities</li>
         <li>I am new to the use of  a laptop so I really have a hard time  typing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Though I have these bad experiences am open to learning and I am greatful it's a new beggining for me</p>
